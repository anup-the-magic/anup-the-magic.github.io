            <p>
              In seeking to recreate the dynamic, immersive bending battles from
              The Legend of Korra, I wanted to create a full end-to-end game to
              to apply everything I've learned. I built the entire game solo in
              <b>Godot</b>, using a player model from Mixamo. Animations, level
              assets, and textures are all either created from scratch in
              <b>Blender</b>, or imported from Mixamo and then edited in
              Blender. As a solo project which I was passionate about, I was
              mindful of keeping the feature-set constrained -- I wanted to make
              sure that the full experience was fleshed out before additional
              breadth was added. With this focus, I was able to ensure that the
              project always felt production-ready, planning for features I knew
              would be necessary down the line and keeping the features
              constrained. With a concrete end goal always at the forefront, I
              was able to build out a foundation for a multiplayer arena
              fighting game in a little under 3 months of dedicated dev work.

            <p>
              The key gameplay loop is governed by stamina and knockback.
              Knockback is a forced movement that increases as players take
              repeated hits, and knockback resistance recovers when not taking
              hits; stamina is a diminishing resource that can be over-drained,
              that recovers with inactivity. Abilities can consume stamina on
              use, or when the player is hit, and abilities can add modifiers to
              amount of knockback taken or even grant dodging invulnerability.

            <p>
              Originally built to test out systems, the enemy controller is
              built to simulate human behavior without significantly changing
              ability controller functionality. Input management system gets
              swapped out depending on if the user is a player or an AI, and the
              character controller is completely isolated from input generation
              -- thus, ability development and improvements to enemy AI can
              occur independently.

            Built out layered state machine for character behavior, implementing
            state transitions based on ability presses, held-button releases,
            stamina exhaustion, and at the end of a timed ability. States can
            have custom entry, exit, and have an explicit API to interact with
            the character controller's state, adding movement speed modifiers,
            knockback reduction, and collision avoidance.

            The final feature before launching a downloadable demo, I built out
            self-hosted peer-to-peer multiplayer sessions. Sessions are joinable
            via IP, and animations and projectiles are synced across clients.
            Hit detection was implemented on the client, while movement is
            managed on the server (with the client sending inputs to be
            validated and handled on the server).

            <!-- TODO: Do we want to keep next steps? -->
            Next steps are to implement clientside movement prediction with
            rollback, and an actual lobby system for larger than 1v1 games.
